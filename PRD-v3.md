# Todo App v3 — Visual Design Overhaul

Improve the visual design of the existing Todo app. The app currently has minimal styling. Make it look modern, polished, and delightful to use. Use the browser to preview your changes as you go.

## Tasks

- [x] Add a global CSS reset and pick a modern color palette. Use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, spacing, and typography. Choose a clean sans-serif font from Google Fonts (e.g., Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans). Apply a soft gradient or subtle pattern to the page background
- [x] Redesign the header area: style the "Todos" heading with proper typography and spacing. Style the Export JSON and Export CSV buttons as pill-shaped outlined buttons with hover effects and icons (use unicode or CSS-only icons)
- [x] Redesign the "Add todo" input: make it a full-width rounded input with a subtle shadow, placeholder animation, and a styled Add button with a hover/active state. Add smooth transitions
- [x] Redesign todo list items: add card-style containers with rounded corners, subtle shadows, and hover elevation effects. Style checkboxes as custom circular checkboxes with a satisfying checked animation. Add strikethrough with opacity change for completed items
- [x] Redesign the subtasks section: indent subtasks visually with a left border accent line. Style the "Subtasks" toggle as a smooth expand/collapse with rotation animation on the arrow. Style subtask items smaller than parent todos but with the same card aesthetic
- [x] Redesign the Delete buttons: make them icon-only (trash icon via CSS/unicode) with a red hover state. Style the delete confirmation dialog as a modal overlay with blur backdrop, rounded corners, and Cancel/Delete buttons
- [x] Add responsive design: ensure the layout looks great on mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1200px+). Center the todo list with a max-width container. Add subtle entrance animations when todos are added (fade-in + slide-up)
